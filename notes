Things I would consider improving if I had more time:
1. Introduce logging via AOP class for all controller/service classes
2. Remove opencsv lib and implement csv reader internally


Things I needed more time to finish:
1. Complete unit tests
2. Add integration tests for controller with successful/failed requests (invalid requests, etc)
3. Create a clear interface for the CSV reader component in order to replace it with JPA data store in future
